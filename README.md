## Introduction
In this dataset, we provided the raw **analog-to-digital-converter** (ADC) data of a **77GHz mmwave** radar for the automotive object detection scenario. The overall dataset contains approximately **19800** frames of radar data as well as synchronized camera images and labels. For each radar frame, its raw data has **_4 dimensions: samples (fast time), chirps (slow time), transmitters, and receivers_**. The experiment radar was assembled from the **TI AWR 1843** board, with 2 horizontal transmit antennas and 4 receive antennas. With **time-division multiplexing** on all transmitters, it can form a 1D-MIMO virtual array with 8 elements. 

The data collection was done on the **campus, road, and parking lot** during the daytime, with the focus of capturing the data for **_six main objects: pedestrian, cyclist, car, motorbike, bus, truck_**. The collected objects can be either **moving (mostly)** or **static**. A single data collection run consisted of multiple objects listed above moving or being static at a normal speed for 30 seconds in front of the testbed. More information in terms of dataset structure, format, tools, and radar configuration was described below.

## Dataset Structure and Format

The dataset consists of multiple sequences, e.g., "2019_04_09_bms1000", "2019_04_09_cms1000". Under each sequence folder, there exists the image folder *"images_0"*, and radar data folder *"radar_raw_frame"*, and label folder *"text_labels"*.

The overall dataset structure is presented as below.

    Automotive
    ---2019_04_09_bms1000
       ---images_0
       ---radar_raw_frame
       ---text_labels
    ---2019_04_09_cms1000
       ......
       
The "radar_raw_frame" folder contains **raw ADC radar data in _.mat_ format**, and "images_0" folder contains **camera images in _.jpg_ format**, and the "text_labels" contains **label files for each frame in _.csv_ format**. The detailed data format is explained below.

**You should match the radar frame, camera image, and labels based on their filenames.** There is some redundant data and you can simply disregard it.

### Radar ADC Data

*  For each radar frame, its raw data (*.mat) has **4 dimension**: 
        
        samples (128), chirps (255), receivers (4), transmitters (2). 

    All transmitters were arranged with *time-division multiplexing* (TDM), i.e., send chirp signals one by one. The example frame structure is shown below:

* The placement of 2 transmitters and 4 receivers was plotted in the left figure below, from the [TI documentation](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra554a/swra554a.pdf). Through TDM, it forms a 1 by 8 MIMO array as shown in the right figure below:

* All radar configurations are included in [config](config.py).

### Camera Image

*  The camera image for each frame is 1440x1080 pixels.

### Labels

*  Each *.csv file include the labels for a frame, with **each row of it in format of _[uid, class, px, py, wid, len]_**, they are,  
        
        uid: the unique tracking id of objects in this sequence
        class: the class id of objects, with the id number represented in label map, 
        px: x-axis center of bounding box in meters within the range of [-20m, 20m]
        py: y-axis center of bounding box in meters within the range of [1m, 24m]
        wid: width of bounding box in meters (corresponding to x-axis)
        len: lengt of bounding box in meters (corresponding to y-axis)
        
        The mapping of class id to objects is:
        label_map = {0: 'person',
                     2: 'car',
                     3: 'motorbike',
                     5: 'bus',
                     7: 'truck',
                     80: 'cyclist',
                     }

Note that there might be a few special cases where the px, py values exceed the provided limit and you may just wanna ignore them or do the clipping.
